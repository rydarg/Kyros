# Kyros
### An android based client app for a project that aims to reduce data consumption across closed networks.

Data consumption often increases due to download of similar data on closed networks, which is often an issue when limited data internet plans are concerned. Kyros is a project that aims to resolve this by using secret sauce and magic at the right opportune moment. Coincidentally, Kyros is a stylised form of Kairos which in Greek translates to *a propitious moment for decision or action*. 

Err, now I'm having second thoughts about the name.
